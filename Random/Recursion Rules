# The rules are:
# 1. Decide on the name of your function and the arguments that must be passed to it
# to complete its work as well as what value the function should return.
# 2. Write the base case for your recursive function first.
# The base case is an if statement that handles a very simple case in the recursive function by returning a
# value.
# 3. Finally, you must call the function recursively with an argument or arguments
# that are smaller in some way than the parameters that were passed to the function
# when the last call was made. The argument or arguments that get smaller are the
# same argument or arguments you examined in your base case.
# 4. Look at a concrete example. Pick some values to try out with your recursive
# function. Trust that the recursive call you made in the last step works. Take the
# result from that recursive call and use it to form the result you want your function
# to return. Use the concrete example to help you see how to form that result.
